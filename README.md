# base
first commit as of 3/12/25
got 4 hours of sleep
and bored
so programmed a base to go off of for the business card
i did it wrong as i need to make it multiple composables and could probably make a bunch of it better
will most likely be unable to focus in class
did this while i could still focus so i could have a base to start off of
dont have access to the code i typed out for the task completed program as i forgot to upload it to github
the slide for thursday mentions using it for a base to go off of
I will update this each time i commit
